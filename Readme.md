HyperExecute is a next-gen test execution platform by LambdaTest, designed to supercharge your test runs with unparalleled speed, scalability, and smart test management. Whether you're running cross-browser tests or executing your CI/CD pipeline, HyperExecute ensures efficiency and speed in the cloud.

HyperExecute is configured using a YAML file. Instead of moving the Hub close to you, HyperExecute brings the test scripts close to the Hub!
